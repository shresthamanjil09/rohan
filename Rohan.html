                    Hello, everyone. I’m writing this post to ask for your help and support for my dear friend Rohan, who is battling
                    cancer. Rohan was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer a few months ago, and he has been undergoing chemotherapy and
                    radiation therapy ever since. He is a fighter, but he needs all the encouragement and positivity he can get.<br>
                    <br>
                    Rohan is one of the kindest, most generous, and most fun-loving people I know. He has always been there for me and many
                    others, whether it was lending a hand, a shoulder, or an ear. He loves music, movies, and traveling, and he has a great
                    sense of humor. He is also a devoted husband and father to his wife and two kids, who are his biggest motivation to keep
                    fighting.<br>
                    <br>
                    As you can imagine, cancer has taken a toll on Rohan’s physical, emotional, and financial well-being. He has been unable
                    to work since his diagnosis, and he is facing mounting medical bills and expenses. He also struggles with the side
                    effects of his treatments, such as fatigue, nausea, and pain. He often feels depressed and hopeless about his situation.
                    That’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting Rohan in any way you can. Here are some things you can do to help
                    him:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send him a card, a message, or a call to let him know that you are thinking of him and that you care. He loves hearing
                    from his friends and family, and he appreciates every word of comfort and encouragement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Pray for him and his family. If you are religious or spiritual, please include Rohan in your prayers and ask for his
                    healing and strength. He believes in the power of prayer and faith.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    If possible please support him financially too. Esewa / Khalti : 9840455174
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to read this post and for your kindness and generosity. Rohan is very grateful for your
                    help and support. He is not giving up on his fight against cancer, and neither should we. Together, we can make a
                    difference in his life.
                </p>
